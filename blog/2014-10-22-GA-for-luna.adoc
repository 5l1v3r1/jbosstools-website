== Installation

JBoss Developer Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply link:/downloads/devstudio/luna/8.0.0.GA.html[download it] and install it like this:

    java -jar jboss-devstudio-{version}-installer-{standalone|eap}.jar

JBoss Tools or JBoss Developer Studio Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) requires a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.4 (Luna) but we recommend using the
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/lunasr1[Eclipse Luna SR1 Java EE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies preinstalled.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you can either find us on Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools (Luna)" or "JBoss Developer Studio (Luna)".

For JBoss Tools you can also use our update site directly if you are up for it.

=== Where is integration stack tooling ?

The integration stack covers the tooling for Fuse, Drools, jBPM, SwitchYard, JBoss ESB etc.

I'm happy to announce that we for now have made them available as "Early access" in JBoss Tools under JBoss Central Software/Update page.

In the near future it is planned to also show up in JBoss Developer Studio and eventually be available as fully supported.
 
== Thank You!

This release would not have been possible without feedback and contributions from our community and the team(s) around Developer Studio. For that I'm truly grateful. Any contribution count!
