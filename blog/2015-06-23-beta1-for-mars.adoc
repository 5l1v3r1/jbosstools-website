== Java 8 required to run, all Java's ok for building

In this Beta we are requiring that you run Eclipse with Java 8.

You can still target development for old Java versions. Yes, you can still target you Java 1.4 projects :)

We are doing this because certain component of Eclipse Mars now requires Java 8 (especially Sapphire) and
according to our usage stats Java 8 will have gained majority this year.

But we have not made JBoss Tools *dependent* on Java 8 yet since we want to get feedback from users on if requiring Java 8 will be a problem.

Let us know on our forum or contact Red Hat support if this will be problem for you to use it.

== Installation

JBoss Developer Studio comes with everything pre-bundled in its installer. Simply download it from our https://www.jboss.org/products/devstudio.html[JBoss Products page]run it like this:
 
    java -jar jbdevstudio-<installername>.jar   

JBoss Tools or Bring-Your-Own-Eclipse (BYOE) JBoss Developer Studio requires a bit more:

This release requires at least Eclipse 4.5 (Mars) but we recommend
using the https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/marsrc3[Eclipse
4.4 JEE Bundle] since then you get most of the dependencies
preinstalled. In case that page it not available check https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/[main eclipse] download for the Mars release.

Once you have installed Eclipse, you either find us on Eclipse Marketplace under "JBoss Tools (Mars)" or "JBoss Developer Studio (Mars)".

For JBoss Tools you can also use our update site directly if you are up for it.

Note: Integration Stack tooling will become available from JBoss Central at an later date.

== What is new ? 

The full details of what is new is available on http://localhost:4242/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.3.0.Beta1.html[this page], below is the highlights.

=== New Shiny Central

JBoss Central now been updated to be faster to load, less overloaded and give access to *any* project example from developer.jboss.org.

=== Docker tooling

There is now tooling to connect to (multiple) Docker daemons which allow you to pull, build, start, stop, etc. Images and Containers.

The Docker tooling is technically part of Eclipse Mars, but we wanted to make it easily available to all JBoss Tools users we have included it into our updatesite. In future releases we will add some specific JBoss Tools integrations for our server adapters and OpenShift - but for now what is included are the vanilla Eclipse Mars Docker tools.

=== Visual Java EE 7 Batch 

We've added visual diagram editor for Java EE 7 Batch tooling. Allowing you to visualize and edit your batch flow.

Big thanks to Tomáš Milata who worked on this for his thesis and contributed the foundation for this functionallity!

Below is a https://www.youtube.com/embed/wmWFQKvTWSc[video] of the highlights of the feature set:

for creating applications from OpenShift/Kubernetes templates.

=== Experimental Launch Bar

The Eclipse CDT project created a new feature called Launcb Bar allowing to easily run launch configurations.
We've added experimental support for using WTP Server adapters (like JBoss server adapters) making it as easy to run as a Java app.

== Next steps

Let us know what you like/hate about the release and if you find
issues open issue at our
https://jira.jboss.org/jira/browse/JBIDE[issue tracker].

Going from Beta1 to Beta2 we are focusing on reported issues and going
for improving Docker, OpenShift, JavaScript and JavaEE related
features.

Hope you enjoy it and remember...

Have fun!
