I did not make it to EclipseCon 2014 since I was enjoying my new found Fatherhood too much.

Thus I was happy when I got invited on board the EclipseCon Program Committee by Martin Lippert (Pivotal) 
to not only have a new reason to go to EclipseCon but also help form next years conference.

To kickstart forming next year conference the https://www.eclipsecon.org/na2015/cfp[Call For Papers] are now open!

EclipseCon 2015 is to be held March 9 - 12 in (sometimes) sunny California at the Hyatt Regency San Francisco Airport.

I look forward to what we will get to see of talks - and I hear it will be not so fun trying to filter everything down
but I'm up for a new kind of challenge.

See you in the CfP's and remember...Have fun!
