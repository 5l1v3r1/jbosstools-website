A few days ago we released link:2014-07-28-beta3-for-luna[JBoss Tools 4.2 Beta3] for Eclipse Luna.

In that update was also a change to our updatesite urls that we recommend for testing our Nightly builds.

In the past if you used `http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/core/master/` we recommend 
you start using the following instead:

Nightly Upatesite: `http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/luna/` 

Note the 'luna' part, this indicates the target Eclipse version - Luna is Eclipse 4.4. Once it is Eclipse 4.5 the nightly build will have 'mars' in the name.

== Why the change ? 

To understand why we are changing it its good to try understand how our builds for JBoss Tools is setup
to have commits in builds be picked up by Jenkins which then publishes the result to our nightly build updatesites.

The following picture is a simplification of the process and how the bits moves through the various sites and gets link:/cat[community tested].

We have ~40 repositories with more or less independent plugins sets on our Github link:https://github.com/jbosstools[jbosstools] organization.
When these change we build an updatesite for each of them and when one is built the content gets aggregated into an "uber" jbosstools updatesite.

In the beginning this was not a big problem but over the years with more traffic users risk having 
update errors because mid in their update because the nightly build kicked in and overwrote the nighlty update site.

To remedy this we now moved to use a nightly *composite* updatesite of a number of previous nightly builds instead. 
This means the updatesite might be slightly slower but you should now not bump (as often) into the case where the nightly updatesite gets removed when you build.

Thus in short - if you are willing to test our JBoss Tools please use this as your nightly updatesite:

`http://download.jboss.org/jbosstools/updates/nightly/luna/`

== Talking about nightly builds...

If you are trying out latest nightly builds why not signup as part of link:../cat[JBoss Tools CAT] member and help by giving us feedback to know if we are going in the right direction ?
