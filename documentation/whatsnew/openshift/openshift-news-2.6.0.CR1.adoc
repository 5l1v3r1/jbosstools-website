== Publish local commits only
In JBoss Tools 4.2.0.Beta3 we introduced a commit dialog that allows you to take full control of the files being published: you can pick the files, provide the commit message etc. +
4.2.0.CR1 simplified the dialog by stripping the number of buttons down to 2: One to cancel and another one to commit and publish. We dropped the ability to commit only: 
if the only thing that you want to do is committing (without pushing), we kindly ask you to use EGit.

Once you selected your files and provided a commit message JBoss Tools will commit and push to OpenShift. 
If there are no local changes (no dirty files or none of the dirty files are selected) but commit(s) that are missing in OpenShift the "Commit and Publish"-button turns to "Publish Only". 
The dialog will then of course warn you that you are only pushing local commits leaving the dirty files alone.

Our commit dialog is based on the http://www.eclipse.org/egit/[EGit] commit dialog and we thus can 	take advantage of existing neat features like the possibility to inspect changes: +
Double click on the dirty files and get a visual diff of them.

== No automatic Commit nor Publishing upon Import
When you import an OpenShift application to your workspace we add/modify a .gitignore file, possibly add an OpenShift profile to your maven pom, etc. +
In prior releases JBoss Tools then committed those changes and then prompted you to publish those changes back to OpenShift.

In CR1 we now made publishing more explicit, we do not commit nor publish upon import. We allow you to decide what files you want to commit, what message you want to use and when you want to publish.

== New Github page for openshift-java-client
Corey Daley, Ninja Hacker and Stackoverflower for OpenShift, created an extensive project page for the openshift-java-client at http://openshift.github.io/openshift-java-client/. 
You can get verbose instructions on how get started, sample code and where to get further help. Kudos!
