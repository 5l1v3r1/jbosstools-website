== JavaScript Development Tools improvements

JSDT now provides an option to turn off internal parsing and validation, which could be useful for users working with big projects, where JavaScript is not the main part of development, by reducing the memory/performance requirements. Also the option could be useful when JSDT is used with 3rd-party tools which provide Content Assisting and Validation for JavaScript.

For such projects the "External Builder/Validator" mode can be selected for ECMAScript compliance level preference, on Window->Preferences->JavaScript->Validator preference page:
