== Performance improvements

In this release, we have fixed a critical performance issue with JBoss Knowledge Base builder for project with large JAR libraries that contain Batch artifacts.
For example, if your Maven project has a dependency on glassfish-embedded-all.jar then it could take more than 5 minutes to build the project just because of this dependency. Now, it takes seconds.
