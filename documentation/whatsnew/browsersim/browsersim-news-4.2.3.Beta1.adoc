CordovaSim has gained basic http://www.feedhenry.com/[FeedHenry] support. Now it is possible to run http://www.feedhenry.com/[FeedHenry] hybrid apps against both `local` and `remote` Node.js server:

== Security note for "Remote" proxy in CordovaSim

Now there is a security warning for *"Remote"* proxy. Basically, If the app is transferring sensitive data (authentication tokens, credentials etc.), it is strongly recommended  to use *"Local"* proxy (enabled by default) instead of the *"Remote"* one.
