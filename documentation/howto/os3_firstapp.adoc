OpenShift Tools provides the `New OpenShift Application` wizard for creating new OpenShift applications from templates. This wizard is the starting point for creating all new OpenShift applications from the IDE and also for importing OpenShift applications to your workspace.

The `New OpenShift Application` wizard is an ideal starting point for new users to OpenShift and OpenShift Tools as it guides you through all the steps necessary to set up the IDE to use your OpenShift account and configure your account ready for applications.

The instructions here demonstrate how to use this wizard and a default OpenShift application template to create a basic OpenShift v3 application. This includes the one-time step of signing up for an OpenShift v3 account. If you have previously used OpenShift or OpenShift Tools, you can omit the one-time step as appropriate.
