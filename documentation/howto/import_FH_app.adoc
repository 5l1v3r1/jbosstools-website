To import your FeedHenry application:

. Click `File` > `Import`.
. Expand `FeedHenry`, click Import Cordova Application, and click `Next`.
. The `Import` wizard displays the projects that you can import into JBoss Developer Studio. Expand the project to import an application from and select the FeedHenry application to be imported.
. In the `Directory` field, enter the location where you want to clone the application locally.
. Click `Finish`.

If you have set a password for the SSH keys, the IDE will prompt you to enter the password so that it can import the application.

=== Test the Application Import 
To test the application import:

. In the `Project Explore` view, right-click the application and then click `Run As` > `Run w/remote FeedHenry server`.  A CordovaSim simulated device displaying the application appears.

== Did You Know

== Troubleshooting 

=== Git Communication Error 

.Git Communication Error
image::FeedHenry_git_communication_error.png[Git Communication Error]

*Error Message*

Problem when cloning the application. This can be due to a network problem or missing security credentials. Refer to error log for details.

**Issue**

When a FeedHenry account is set up, the user’s API Keys are configured by default, but the SSH Public key must be manually configured. Importing a FeedHenry application into JBoss Developer Studio means that the application repository is accessed via Git. Without a Public SSH key, the IDE is unable to complete the action and this error appears.

*Resolution*

. Click `OK` to close the `Git Communication Error` window. 
. Log into FeedHenry at: `https://_[your-studio-domain]_.feedhenry.com`. 
. Click the icon located in the uppermost right-side corner of the screen to display the context menu. 
. Click `Settings` > `SSH Key Management` and then click `Add New Key`.
. In the `Public Key` field, enter your SSH Public key. An existing Public SSH key is available at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Alternatively, generate a new Public SSH key with the following command:
[source]
----
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "username@example.com"
----


=== Invalid Preferences 

.Invalid Preferences
image::invalid_preferences_error_2.png[Invalid Preferences]

*Issue*

When the user logs into FeedHenry for the first time, the `Invalid Preferences` dialog box appears informing the user that the FeedHenry connection preferences are unidentified or invalid and that the user must correct the preferences. Refer to the <<set_preferencess,Set the Preferences>> section for details to set the connection preferences.
